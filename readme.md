# DWM_ReactiveUI
## DENO Desktop ReactiveUI  

No Browser!  No WebView! Just a cross-platform desktop window!


<br/>
 
## Warning: POC-WIP project
The purpose of this Proof Of Concept project is to test the validity of a _Deno-Window-Manager Graphical-User-Interface_ framework; proving that the proposed framework can work in real life examples.  This is a _Work-In-Progress_ project, and is in no way ready for production. You should expect constant-change while I play with the design and implementation.

<br/>
  
This experimental UI framework wraps both Deno Window Manager and skia-canvas.

To run the Dice-Game example, with Deno installed, run:
```
deno run -A --unstable https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhrones/DWM-ReactiveUI/main/Examples/DiceGame/main.ts
```
 
<br/>

To run the multi-line text example, with Deno installed, run:
```
deno run -A --unstable https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhrones/DWM-ReactiveUI/main/Examples/TextArea/main.ts
```
